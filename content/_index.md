## cndofx blog

Hi! I'm cndofx. I like computers and work on lots of projects
involving things like programming, reverse engineering, game development,
linux, and more. Some projects have me wishing that I had documented
my process more formally both so I could reference it in the future and
so I could share my learning with others. I'm writing this blog so that
I have a place to do just that.
